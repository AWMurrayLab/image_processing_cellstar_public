# image_processing_cellstar_public
These scripts were used to integrate and analyze fluorescence images to generate data for single cell cycles for the 
publication "Cell size regulation in budding yeast does not depend on linear accumulation of Whi5".  
Readers should first read through the README_image_processing.pdf file.
